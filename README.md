This is a community effort to track issues and proposals related to specifications for representing Sinhala in Unicode. Also, this repos hosts documents and URLs relevant to anybody attempting to implementing support for Sinhala Unicode in software and tools.

## Scope
This repo and the issue tracker is only focusing on infrastructure level issues related to representing Sinhala in computers. Which means it focuses only on the issues, errors or updates to specifications, standards and [software libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) that is used by other user facing softwares or tools such as;

- Standards
  - Sinhala chapter of The UnicodeÂ® Standard - Core Specification
  - Sri Lanka Standard 1134 - Sinhala Character Code For Information Interchange (SLS 1134)
  - OpenType specification for Sinhala

- Libraries
  - Harfbuzz

This project dose not intend to track issues with implementations of user-facing software such as fonts, word-processors, desktop publishing tools. However, the issue tracker is open to discussing issues related to implementations by developers of such software. Also, it is better to discuss certain issues in the respective forums or issue trackers in some instances. (ie; Unicode mailing list)
